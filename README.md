# Simple Weather App

A simple weather application that displays the current temperature, weather condition, and location based on the user's geographical position.

---

## Features

- Fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Display current temperature with the ability to switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Simple and responsive user interface.

---

## Usage
1. Place the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the same folder.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser.
3. Click on the displayed temperature to cycle between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
4. The selected temperature unit is saved in the browser and preserved for future visits.

## Important Notes
